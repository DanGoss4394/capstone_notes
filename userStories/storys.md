# The app

This app is a streamers Fan page that allows the user to Create an accont that allows them to invite their fans to one page that allows the streamer to send out Notifications/Updates on whats going on. This is a portfolio page for the owner/admin that allows them to have a blog page and schedule page. This app will have a landing page that is connected to all pages. When a user is registering for the first time they must pick if they are a creator or a fan. The owner/admin needs to be able to upload pictures, add an remove text, they will be allowed to create a schedule. The fans need to be able to add or remove their own text and pictures. Guest users can only read blogs, look at the about me page but can not upload any images or text and when they try to do either an alert should pop up that tells them to make an account before those actions are allowed. This app needs to be able to connect to an api that allows the owner/admin to set up links to other sites(social media).
